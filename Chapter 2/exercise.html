  <h1>First exercise</h1>
  <p>1. Create one simple loading animation using three divs that contain an
animation. Each one should be filled by a black background color that
increases the size from 0 to 20 px in height and width in a sequence. So, the
first animation starts first, the second has a longer delay than the first one,
and the third has more delay than the second one in an infinite loop.</p>
